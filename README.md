# Multiple-Layered-Echo-State-Network
Matlab Implementation of Multiple Layered Echo State Network

Implementation of a novel architecture and learning algorithm for a multilayered echo state machine (ML-ESM). 
Traditional echo state networks (ESNs) refer to a particular type of reservoir computing (RC) architecture. 
They constitute an effective approach to recurrent neural network (RNN) training, with the (RNN-based) reservoir generated 
randomly, and only the readout trained using a simple computationally efficient algorithm. 
ESNs have greatly facilitated the real-time application of RNN, and have been shown to outperform classical approaches 
in a number of benchmark tasks. We introduces a novel criteria for integrating multiple layers of reservoirs 
within the ML-ESM. The addition of multiple layers of reservoirs are shown to provide a more robust alternative to conventional 
RC networks.
